<h1>Movie Reviews by Abtahi</h1>
<h2>My last 3 movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Shehzada</h3>
<p>It is a remake of tamil movie but was quite entertaining. The humor and action was pretty good.</p>
<h3>No Smoking</h3>
<p>IT is about smoking where the lead character is constantly smoking whenever he is awake. The starting was good, comedy was also entertaining but the ending was pure unga bunga.</p>
<h3>Blue Beetle</h3>
<p>Quite average DC superhero movie. Enjoyed it but not one of my top superhero films which I would recommend.</p>
